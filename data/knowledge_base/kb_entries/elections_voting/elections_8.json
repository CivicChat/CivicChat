  "content": "Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) lets voters rank candidates in order of preference instead of choosing only one. If no candidate gets a majority, the lowest-ranked candidates are eliminated and votes are redistributed until someone wins. Washington DC does not currently use Ranked Choice Voting. DC ballots use a simple 'choose one' system for each race.",
