  "content": "Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) is used in some U.S. cities, but Washington DC does not currently use it. DC ballots use a simple 'choose one' voting method for each race. Although RCV has been discussed by advocacy groups and community members, it has not been adopted by the DC Council or implemented by the DC Board of Elections. Any change to the voting system would require legislative action and additional planning, such as updating voting machines, educating voters, and coordinating with Congress, which oversees parts of DC's laws.",
